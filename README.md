# university-database

The project includes basic design requirements. It also has a two-level menu. 
In the first menu level, you can create, delete, and select a database. Loading and saving to file will be added in the future. 
In the second level of the menu there are operations on a single database included in the requirements. 
The tests were written without the use of test libraries.
